# reactjs-whatsapp-clone
A full-stack Whatsapp web clone with multiple chats room. I am using Firestore DB to make a live chat possible and using google auth. to get each unique user.

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm init`



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
